Using Grunt and local development
---------------------------------

Before getting started using Grunt, you'll need to install [Node.js version 6.14.4](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v6.14.4/). Once you have Node installed, you'll need to install the project
dependencies:

```
npm install
```

If you are on a Mac and do not have root administrator permissions, you may need to use sudo:

```
sudo npm install
```

With the dependencies installed, you can run the default dev tasks:

```
grunt
```


Local Development
-------------------
Local web server:
```
grunt dev
```
